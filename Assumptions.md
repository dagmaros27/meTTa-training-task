# Assumptions

For the implementation of the given tasks i made the following assumptions:

1. The tree is a binary tree. i.e any node will have atmost two children
2. The tree given as an argument for the functions is a valid binary tree, null trees are not also handled as they are not specifically mentioned
3. I assumed the representation of the tree as given in the example. i.e a tree/subtree is an expression with atmost three symbols which are root, left child (if exist) and right child (if exist).
   for example, (a (b c) d) - this is a binary tree with four nodes, a is the root with b and d as children of it (for the given task the side of the child nodes is not important) and c is the child node of b as it is in a subtree.
